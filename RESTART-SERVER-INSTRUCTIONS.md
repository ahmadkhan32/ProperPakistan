The server needs to be restarted to load the updated auth controller with detailed logging.

**Please do this:**

1. In the server terminal (where `npm run dev` is running)
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
3. Run `npm run dev` again to restart

**Then try logging in again** with:
```
Email:    admin@properpakistan.com
Password: Pakistan@2026
```

After you try to login, the server terminal will show detailed logs with emojis like:
- 🔍 Sync user request received
- ❌ Error messages
- ✅ Success steps

**Send me a screenshot or copy the server terminal output** after you try to login so I can see the exact error.
